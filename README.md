Magnetic Resonance BIomarker Assessment Software (MR-BIAS) is an automated tool for extracting quantitative MR parameters from phantom images. The software has been developed and tested for use on the following phantoms:
* Relaxometry phantoms such as the [ISMRM/NIST system phantom](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.28779) and the [Eurospin TO5 phantom](https://leedstestobjects.com/index.php/phantom/magiq-set-to1-to5/)
* Diffusion phantoms such as the [NIST/NCI/RSNA/QIBA diffusion phantom](https://qmri.com/product/diffusion-phantom/)

## Getting started
An overview of the motivation and basic usage details of the software are discussed in [a presentation at the ESMRMB MRITogether conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgFzDnjO4Jw&list=PLeDygc8TN_J65c0jM0ms__diTMylbEk9l&index=14&t=18m14s). We have put together [a range of tutorials ](./documentation/tutorials.md), including the following which are aimed at getting people started with using MR-BIAS: 

- [Tutorial 1: Installation instructions](./documentation/how_to_install.md)
- [Tutorial 2: How to analyse relaxometry images](./documentation/basic_analysis_relaxometry.md)
- [Tutorial 3: How to analyse diffusion images](./documentation/basic_analysis_diffusion.md)

Please [contact us](./documentation/contact.md) if you have any questions, would like help getting the software working on your data, or are keen to contribute to the project.
