# Tutorials

We are working on a number of tutorials to help users start analysing thier datasets with MR-BIAS, to provide guidance on how to adjust the analysis, and how to modify the software.

## Basic usage
These tutorials are to show how to use the software to analyse a provided example datasets. If you are new to the tool, we recommend you start with the following tutorials:
- [Tutorial 1: how to analyse relaxometry images (under construction)](./basic_analysis_relaxometry.md)
- [Tutorial 2: how to analyse diffusion images (under construction)](./basic_analysis_diffusion.md)

## Adjusting the analysis
MR-BIAS supports a number of quantitative phantoms, signal models of quantitative parameters (T1, T2, T2*, ADC), MRI scanner manufacturers and imaging protocols. There are also a range of other settings which can be used to customise the analysis. These tutorials provide a list of the available settings, including the default settings, and guidance on which setting may be best for your application.
- [Tutorial 3: an description available configuration options (under construction)](./configuration_options_all.md)
- [Tutorial 4: how to write your own configuration file (under construction)](./writing_a_config_file.md)
- [Tutorial 5: how to programatically change your configuration options for an advanced analysis (under construction)](./advanced_config_file_update.md)

## Modifying the software for your application
These tutorials provide some guidance on how you can modify the software to tailor it to your application. You might need to add a new scanner protocol if your sequences or scanner are not covered by our existing options. You might have built your own cool custom phantom and want to add a new ROI template to analyse it with MR-BIAS. You can even add a new signal models if you're interested in measuring a different parameter or have a come up with a more elegant mathematical description

- [Tutorial 7: adding a new region of interest template for a different phantom (needs to be updated)](./adding_a_roi_template.md)
- [Tutorial 8: adding a new signal model for curve fitting data](./adding_a_new_model.md)
